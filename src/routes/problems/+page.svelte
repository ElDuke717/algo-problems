    <h1>Leetcode 1 - Two Sum</h1> 
    
    <h2>The first and possibly the most famous problem in all of Leetcode</h2>
    
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
    <p>Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.</p>
    <p>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.</p>
    <p>You can return the answer in any order.</p>
    
    <p>Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9</p>
    <p>Output: [0,1]</p>
    <p>Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Leetcode problems are tough! The first time I looked at this problem, I didn't even understand what specifically it was asking for! But don't worry, this and other problems can be solved with some determination and a bit of practice.</p>
    
    <p>Essentially, what we're tasked with here is to find the indices of the two elements that can be added together to reach a target. The first argument is our array of numbers and the second the target number. The output is an array of the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.</p>
    
    <p>Here, I'll show two solutions - a brute force solution and an optimized one with exmplanations for each to hopefully help you understand the problem and how to solve it.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Brute Force Solution</h2>
    <p>First, here's the brute force solution:</p>
